## Client Brief

**Client:** Lachlan: Summer Program Coordinator at Sol Camps  
**Purpose:** To create a simple website that clearly explains Sol Camps’ summer program and helps families easily get in touch.  
**Audience:** Parents and guardians researching summer programs, and students who want to learn what the camp offers.  
**Key action:** Contact Sol Camps or submit interest in the summer program.

**Pages/sections needed:**
- Home (overview of Sol Camps and brief introduction)
- Summer Program (dates, ages, location, basic daily schedule)
- Contact (email information and simple inquiry form)

**Content status:** I have general information about the program. I still need final dates, confirmed location details, pricing information (if included), and 1–2 official photos or a logo from Sol Camps.

**Style preferences:** Very simple and clean. Minimal colors, easy-to-read fonts, straightforward layout, and mobile-friendly design. No heavy animations or complex styling.

**Inspiration sites:**
- Basic summer camp websites - liked their simple layout and clear navigation  
- Simple educational program pages - liked the clear headings and easy-to-find contact information
